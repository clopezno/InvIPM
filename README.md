# InvIPM: Optimizing Image Segmentation in Metallic Objects Using Illumination-Invariant Transforms

## Overview

For objects of a metallic nature, illumination generates specular reflections and shadows, which must be minimized to achieve accurate image segmentation. This work proposes to apply illumination invariant transforms before image segmentation to significantly improve processing results. As a case study, a comprehensive set of input images with metallic parts is provided.

## InvIPM Application Description

InvIPM is a MATLAB desktop application that enables users to:

- Load images of metallic objects
- Apply various illumination-invariant transforms
- Perform clustering-based segmentation methods
- Quantify segmentation quality using ground truth comparisons

The application provides an intuitive interface for comparing different processing approaches and evaluating their effectiveness.
